# Lucy's Very Cool and Epic Screenshot Graphics Settings Mod Thing<br /><sup>(working title)</sup><br/>

Take nice screenshots without ever opening the vanilla graphics options menu!

It's exactly what it says on the tin:
- It's a Fabric 1.20.x mod (older versions are likely to work too)
- It lets you change FOV and terrain fog settings in-game without opening settings
- It's very cool and epic
- The last one was a lie, it's very WIP and kinda bad
